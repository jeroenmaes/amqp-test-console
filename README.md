# artemis-test-console
.net sender/receiver sample using [ArtemisNetClient](https://havret.github.io/dotnet-activemq-artemis-client/)

This sample illustrates the usage of the ArtemisNetClient client. 
It started out as a sample only using the AmqpNetLite client, but that one does not support failover.
The ArtemisNetClient is based on AmqpNetLite and comes with failover support out of the box.
